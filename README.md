## About MEANboard

MEANboard is an open source dashboard framework starter-kit project based on [Freeboard](https://github.com/Freeboard/freeboard) and [MEAN.JS](https://github.com/meanjs/mean):
* Freeboard is a UI frontend framework for Dashboards which provides the JavaScript infrastructure for generating a dashboard layout, widgets, and polling for information from the client side to remote APIs.
* MEAN.JS is the open source MEAN stack framework for developing JavaScript based apps on-top of NodeJS, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and MongoDB. This project doesn't actually make use of the AngularJS part because it uses Freeboard.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install grunt globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get the project running is to use git to directly clone the MEANboard:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lirantal/meanboard.git meanboard
```

This will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a **meanboard** folder.

## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your MEAN application.

The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application. To learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.

To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again. In the application folder run this in the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

* explore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options


## Support

This project is based on the master 0.4 version of MEAN.JS.
